This is a refuge from Tumblr, a place where collectibles are shunned, suspended, and terminated without due process or explanation.
Tumblr has a vibrant, idiosyncratic community (see lengthy blog dedicated to the flaccid penis because men too often hide behind their erections), which I will miss in my exile.
I plan to infrequently and irregularly post about the collectible generator.
